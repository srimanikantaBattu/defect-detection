# 🔍 Defect Detection using IR Thermography

Infrared (IR) Thermography is a non-destructive testing method widely used in industrial applications for identifying surface and sub-surface defects. This project leverages IR Thermography for real-time defect detection in materials and components, enhancing maintenance and quality control processes.

## 📌 Project Overview

This mini project was developed to demonstrate how thermal imaging can be effectively used to detect structural faults or anomalies. The system processes thermal data captured from IR cameras to identify hotspots, discontinuities, and hidden defects that may not be visible through regular inspection.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **IR Thermography**
- **Data Analysis & Processing**
- **Visual Inspection Techniques**
- **Machine Learning** *(if applicable)*

## 📚 Project Highlights

- ✅ Captured thermal signatures of materials using IR imaging.
- ✅ Processed and analyzed thermal data to identify defect patterns.
- ✅ Demonstrated accurate and efficient detection of faults for industrial use.
- ✅ Designed the system to support real-time inspection environments.
